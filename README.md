Dota 2 Statics
=========================== 
Building a program that will receive a player's ID and return the last games played with statics that can help someone prepare or learn from the player. I do not own the API beign used. It belongs to [Joshua Duffy](https://github.com/joshuaduffy/dota2api).

## What do I need to use it?
- The absolute first thing you will need to use this application is to have an [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
