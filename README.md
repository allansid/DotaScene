- [Functions explained](https://github.com/divinoob/DotaScene#functions-explained)

## What do I need to use it?
- The absolute first thing you will need to use this application is to have an [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
- You need to download the [dota2api](https://github.com/joshuaduffy/dota2api).
- You need to download the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) language from their website.
- I'm currently working on some changes so that you won't need to download both python and API in order to run the application
- Run on your CMD while under the folder where you downloaded my application:
`
	python dotaStats.py
`

## Modifications on files
You will need to change the fileDirectory variable (line 10 on file dotaStats.py) and put your directory to the folder where the txt file that you want all the information to be saved, and change the accountDirectory as well. For exemple:

`
	fileDirectory = "C:\\Users\\Vin√≠cius\\Documents\\UFPE\\Coding\\Python\\Dota\\txtResults\\"
`

That's the file path to the folder where my txt file is.
